A FORMER employee of the Department of Co-operative Governance (Cogta) who pleaded guilty yesterday to five counts of corruption, fraud and theft by false pretences involving R41 650, blamed his gambling addiction for his crimes.   He was not ordered to repay the R3 800 he corruptly elicited from a fifth victim, Nokuthula Cynthia Gabuza, because he was arrested by members of the Organised Crime Unit directly after he was paid the money at the Umfolozi Casino near Empangeni on October 3, 2012, and the money was taken away from him.
