It was largely driven out of Uganda in the mid-2000s but has held out in eastern Congo.Government spokesperson Lambert Mende said three other soldiers in the vehicle were also killed in the attack. Ndala was travelling without a military escort, he said.In the regional capital Goma, where many regarded the colonel as a hero for organising the defence of the town from the M23 rebels, residents flocked to his home, locals said. Traffic was thin and many shops closed their shutters amid fears of protests.Millions of people have died in eastern Congo from violence, disease and hunger since the 1990s as foreign-backed insurgents have waged a series of rebellions, often for control of the region's rich deposits of gold, diamonds and tin.ADF-Nalu has been blamed for a spate of recent attacks and kidnappings around the town of Beni in North Kivu, including for the deaths of at least 60 civilians in two attacks last month. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
