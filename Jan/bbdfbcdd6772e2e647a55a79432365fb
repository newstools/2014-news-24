Marsabit is particularly vulnerable because of a perennial conflict between two pastoralist communities. Clashes in recent weeks have left scores dead and security forces were deployed to restore calm. The areas around the towns of Wajir and Mandera in the country's northeast are also at risk as rainfall there was insufficient, Gullet said.In 2011 two successive failed rainy seasons in the space of 12 months led to the driest year since 1951 in arid regions of Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Uganda.The drought decimated herds and had a devastating impact on pastoralist communities.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
