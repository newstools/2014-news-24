According to New Zimbabwe.com, experts say a number of factors contribute to hunger in Zimbabwe, with poor agricultural practices remaining one of them. Unavailability or high cost of agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizers, adverse weather and decrease in acreage have also remained major contributing factors. According to Secretary for Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development Ringson Chitsiko government could not adequately support small holder farmers. Although gains have been registered in crops such as tobacco, Zimbabwe remains a net-food importer. Production in the 2012-13 season is projected to have fallen to 789 000 tons, and the government has spent $60 m importing grain from Zambia, the report said. Food shortages have plagued Zimbabwe since 2000 when agricultural production decreased dramatically.
