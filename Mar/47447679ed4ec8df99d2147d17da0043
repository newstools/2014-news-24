"Secondly, the dam will supply water to the mines in order to help unlock vast mineral deposits, mainly in the form of platinum group metals found in the region."The construction of the dam was one of the projects that fell under the umbrella of the Presidential Infrastructure Co-ordinating Commission which was established in 2012 to co-ordinate and fast-track infrastructure projects.Water demandZuma said previously people in the area had to walk long distances to get fresh water, and the borehole water was insufficient to meet the demand."The bulk distribution system connected to the dam will ensure that over a period of time, all the people of this area will be served with an uninterrupted water supply, which is the ultimate goal of government," said Zuma."We have introduced central co-ordination of the work of national, provincial and local government to take forward major projects such as dams, bridges, schools, hospitals, roads, power stations, universities, further education and training colleges and a host of other project that improve the quality of life and boost economic growth," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
