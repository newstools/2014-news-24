It is one of the oldest but lesser known rebellions based in North-Kivu and is considered the only Islamist organisation in the region.The Brussels-based think tank International Crisis Group said in a report last year the rebel group had "shown remarkable resilience attributable to its geostrategic position, its successful integration into the cross-border economy and corruption in the security forces".ADF-Nalu is led by Jamil Mukulu, a Christian convert to Islam, and has never really managed to take its fight against Yoweri Museveni's regime to Uganda.Some observers have voiced concern that it could become a link in the growing network of radical Islamist groups in East Africa.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
