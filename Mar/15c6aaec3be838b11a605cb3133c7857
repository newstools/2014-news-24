Iset's name and royal title are inscribed near her feet, but her face has suffered from erosion.Amenhotep III presided over an era which saw a renaissance in Egyptian art. He was succeeded by his son Akhenaten, the sun-worshipping pharaoh credited by some for starting the world's first known monotheistic religion.Some of ancient Egypt's biggest monuments were constructed during Amenhotep III's reign.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
