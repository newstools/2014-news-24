	     The case against the boy was postponed to 7 April, as it
had been transferred to the Mokopane Magistrate's Court in Limpopo, police
spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi said in a statement. This was because the bodies of the couple were found on
their farm Merebank near Lephalale in Limpopo on Friday. The youth was arrested in Mossel Bay on Monday morning. "The... minor was arrested at his guardian's
house," said Mulaudzi. Police found the bodies of the 69-year-old man and
66-year-old woman after their relatives had been unable to contact them. "The couple's bodies were found in the decomposing
state and a post-mortem will be conducted this week to determine the cause of
death," said Mulaudzi. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
