	     Johannesburg - A security guard has been jailed for 18 years for rape in Helpmekaar, KwaZulu-Natal police said on Thursday. Captain Thulani Zwane said Khawulani Patrick Magubane was sentenced by the Dundee Regional Court on Wednesday. "He was convicted... for the rape of a mentally challenged woman in one of the old age homes in Helpmekaar." Magubane apparently in 2012 went to the 29-year-old woman's room claiming he wanted to make sure she was still safe. When she opened the door he pulled her outside and raped her. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
