The French-Moroccan and the Frenchman were detained on Monday after allegedly "engaging in activism and propaganda" including disseminating press releases and video recordings "apologising for terrorist acts," the MAP state news agency said, quoting a ministry statement. It said the two men were preparing to join the ISIS group, whose fighters have seized large parts of Iraq and Syria. The Algerian was arrested in the central city of Fez after allegedly planning to travel to join his wife, who is already a member of IS, the statement said. In mid-October authorities announced the arrest of a Moroccan, with his two young French daughters in tow, as he sought to join up with the extremist group. More than 2 000 Moroccan jihadists, including those with dual nationality, are now fighting in Syria and Iraq, authorities say. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
