Former football star Marc Batchelor has described mounting tension between the Steenkamp and Pistorius families during sentencing proceedings in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria. He said the tension led to an altercation between Paralympian Oscar Pistorius’ sister Aimee and self-confessed killer Mikey Schultz, The Star reported today. He was in court last week with Pistorius’ ex-girlfriend Samantha Taylor, Schultz, and others because they may have been called to testify. He said Aimee had stared them down and there had been tension when they met in and out of court. Aimee was in tears last week after Schultz sat on the bench occupied for the Pistorius family and allegedly told her to “f*ck off”. Batchelor said they were told to sit there by the prosecution in case they were called as witnesses. Sentencing in Pistorius’ case would be handed down tomorrow. On September 12, Pistorius was convicted of culpable homicide for the Valentine’s Day 2013 shooting of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in his Pretoria townhouse. Schultz confessed to killing mining tycoon Brett Kebble in 2005.
