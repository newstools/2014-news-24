KwaZulu-Natal s education MEC Peggy Nkonyeni has sent a delegation in haste to a Durban school in a bid to prevent its closure.Named after President Jacob Zuma, the JG Zuma High School was closed today by the school board of trustees over apparent non-payment of funds to the trustees.Nkonyeni s spokesperson Isaac Luthuli said the department had been forced to stop payments to the trustees because they had failed for more than a year to comply with certain legal requirements. We indicated that their non-compliance with various pieces of legislation governing use of public funds will eventually create disharmony between the trustees and the department. Still they have not complied. They are fully aware of their non-compliance. While he did not elaborate on the exact nature of the compliance, the school is located on private property in Durban s KwaMashu area but is government-funded.In terms of section 14 of the Schools Act, such schools need to meet certain requirements such as access and security.Luthuli said if the delegation had no success with persuading the unpaid board of trustees to reopen the school, the department would approach the courts.Attempts to contact the school and the school board were unsuccessful.Initially built in 1997 in the Besters area of KwaMashu, the school was called Ekuthuleni Combined School and later split into a high school and a primary school.The primary school kept the name Ekuthuleni, while the high school was named after Zuma, who was then deputy president.The school is well known for its choir, which has sung at public events where Zuma has officiated and has toured overseas.Luthuli said there were no issues with teachers salaries or supplies from the department to the school.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
