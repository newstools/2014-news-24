They are expected to appear in the Pretoria Regional Court on Monday.Makgale said this brought the number of people arrested for recruitment fraud and corruption to 18. Twelve of these people were SAPS employees - five of them police officers, the other seven civilians.Eight of the 18 people arrested were from the Soweto police station. Those arrested include Benoni cluster commander, Brigadier Vuyokazi Ndebeni.
