The church had ignored two warnings to stop building."Alleluia Ministries International has been shocked by media reports that we are busy constructing our church building illegally," Khangale said."All our architectural plans including the soil analysis are in place."He said skilled engineers were working closely with the city council on the building project.A construction artisan had put too much concrete on a corner slab "and a small part of it fell", he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
