We are going to do everything to find them," Ndibeche said.The assault comes at a time of growing alarm in North Kivu, a mineral-rich province bordering Rwanda and Uganda that has long been plagued by dozens of armed militias.Last week, suspected rebels from the Ugandan ADF-NALU group carried out two overnight raids near the town of Beni, 50km north of Butembo, killing more than 50 people.Ndibeche said that highway bandits were the most likely culprits in the prison break given that group's strong representation among the prison population. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
