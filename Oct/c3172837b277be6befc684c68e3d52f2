Nalini NaidooTHE election of a new leader for the ANC&rsquo;s Moses Mabhida Region, which incorporates Pietermaritzburg and the Midlands, may be a one horse race. The ANC Youth League in the region yesterday announced that it had unanimously endorsed former regional secretary Super Zuma for election as chairperson in the upcoming regional conference, while current chairperson Alpha Shelembe confirmed earlier reports that he has pulled out of the race. It is not clear if there are other contenders, or whether certain branches would still go ahead and nominate Shelembe and put pressure on him to stand. However, Shelembe made it clear he would not be standing as he had moved beyond regional politics and also felt it was time for new blood.The conference at which the leadership will be elected is due to take place on November 8 and 9.ANCYL regional secretary Mawonga Mazibuko said they supported Zuma for the position because he was committed to unity in the region. He said the local youth were also confident that with the incoming regional executive committee, the Metro status of uMgungundlovu will finally be achieved. The Moses Mabhida region has been deeply divided on whether Msunduzi should gain metro status or whether this status should be granted to the uMgungundlovu District Municipality that incorporates Msunduzi. The ANC Youth League&rsquo;s statement indicates that metro status could become a key lobbying issue for the ANC in the region.&bull; nalini@witness.co.za24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
