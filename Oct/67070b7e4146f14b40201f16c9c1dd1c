Siso Naile A BABY duiker was almost certainly saved from the pot yesterday by workers from the FreeMe wildlife rehabilitation centre. The duiker is among five that are currently at the centre. The small male duiker was found in a dog harness, tied to the back of a bakkie in a garden in Howick. According to FreeMe centre manager Roz Marais the centre was alerted by a Howick resident who reported seeing the little creature tied to the bakkie. “Israel Silevu and Brian Mphanga responded. The duiker was found unharmed and it was safely moved to its new home at the centre,” she said. The owner of the bakkie was nowhere to be found. Marais said it was probable the duiker was going to be killed and eaten by its captors. “No member of the public is allowed to keep indigenous animals or birds as pets,” she said. Currently, the centre has five duiker, two serval, a bush pig and a variety of garden birds at the centre. Marias said one of the duikers was rescued after it was bitten by dogs, another was found lying next to the road and others were retrieved from snares. “Our wildlife is under threat from development and destruction of habitat, and we really do need to help them as much as possible, because the bulk of our patients come to the centre as a direct result of human impact,” she said. “FreeMe deals with all sorts of indigenous animals and birds. We regularly get in antelope. They are either babies that have been orphaned or adults that have been hit by cars, caught in snares, attacked by dogs, etc. These include grey and blue duiker, bush buck, reedbuck, impala, blesbok, oribi and nyala. We also get small predators such as genets, jackal, mongooses, and servals,” said Marais. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
