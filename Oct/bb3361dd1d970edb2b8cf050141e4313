Witness Reporter MANGO Airlines has advised the public that it has discovered a fraudulent Instagram account bearing the airline’s brandname and promising complimentary flights for 12 500 people. Mango has initiated the removal of the account. Mango’s Hein Kaiser said consumers should not engage, interact or follow the fraudulent Instagram presence nor provide any personal information in connection with the “disingenuous offer” to any party outside the airline’s official communication channels. “We have received quite a number of queries since last night. “I’m guessing this is another one of those Internet fraud criminals trying to access personal details and account information,” Kaiser said. Mango’s official online presence comprises its website, mobisite, apps for Android, Apple and Blackberry 10 devices, Facebook (www.facebook.com/flymangosa) and Twitter (@flymangosa). 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
