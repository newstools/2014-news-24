Islamist militants seized the capital Tripoli in August, forcing the internationally-recognized government and parliament to move to the east.The prosecutor reiterated a demand for the Libyan government to hand over Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, for prosecution by the ICC in the Hague and said she may review the decision to allow the trial in Libya of Gaddafi's intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi.Despite the growing concern over alleged mass crimes, Bensouda said that her office had been forced to scale down investigations in Libya due to lack of resources.Human Rights Watch said it had documented attacks on civilians by armed militias that may amount to war crimes, politically-motivated assassinations and cases of torture, forced displacement and arbitrary detentions that could amount to crimes against humanity.The rights group is asking the UN Human Rights Council to set up a commission of inquiry to investigate violations by all sides.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
