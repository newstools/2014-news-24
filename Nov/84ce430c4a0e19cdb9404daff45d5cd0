If, for instance, it were to find that there are serious challenges within the institution that require drastic measures to be taken to address them, like appointing a commission of inquiry that has full powers to subpoena and compel people to appear before it, then it would so recommend. Mncube said Nxasana was dealing with the report and would take appropriate steps when he had finished studying the report.The stalemate at the top levels of the NPA has now dragged into its fifth month, with Nxasana himself facing an inquiry into his fitness to hold office.Masutha this week said there was still no update on Nxasana s fate at the NPA. At this stage, we ve not yet reached a point where we can make an announcement on what the status of the matter is, save to say it is still very much being dealt with between our office and, of course, the office of the presidency. In July, President Jacob Zuma announced there would be a commission of inquiry into Nxasana s fitness to hold office.But the threat of an urgent interdict led to negotiations between Zuma and Nxasana, who believes he was the victim of a ploy by Jiba and Mrwebi to oust him.Both Jiba and Mrwebi, as well as Sibongile Mzinyathi, the director of public prosecutions for south Gauteng, have also had criminal charges laid against them in relation to their management of criminal charges in the case of suspended crime intelligence head Richard Mdluli.Nxasana has made representations to Masutha requesting that the president suspend Jiba, Mrwebi and Mzinyathi, another process where there have been no developments.On Thursday, Masutha said the matter was receiving attention, but he was not in a position to provide furtherdetails. A senior NPA source told City Press that the matter was now in the hands of the politicians .24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
