Media queries that resulted in the deputy chairperson of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) paying back R6 000 in entertainment expense claims were part of a smear campaign, the commission has said. “The Electoral Commission was approached recently by a newspaper with queries regarding entertainment expenses claimed by members of the commission,” spokesperson Marco Granelli said today. “It was clear that this was part of a smear campaign to discredit members of the commission linked to the process to appoint a replacement commissioner and chairperson.” The Beeld reported today that Terry Tselane paid back the IEC in order to restore the damage to his name and reputation. Tselane and two other IEC commissioners, Bongani Finca and Raenette Taljaard, faced allegations of mismanagement and misspending the IEC’s money during the process of appointing a new chairperson in place of Pansy Tlakula, according to the report. Tselane reportedly put an expensive meal and drinks at a luxury Sandton restaurant on the IEC’s account, despite it not being for work purposes, the newspaper said. He allegedly used the IEC’s equipment, stationery and staff for his recent wedding, it said. However, Granelli said all Tselane’s expenses were “legitimate business expenses and were approved in line with Electoral Commission’s policies”. Granelli said Tselane’s entertainment expenses averaged less than R500 a year for the 13 years he had been employed at the IEC. “Commissioner Tselane decided to personally pay for these in the light of the personal attacks on his reputation,” Granelli said. Tselane told Beeld that his colleagues had assisted with planning his wedding, but that they had volunteered to do so. He also attributed claims of misspending as being part of a smear campaign. The public protector was doing a preliminary investigation into allegations against the three commissioners, the newspaper reported.
