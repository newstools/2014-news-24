Nalini NaidooSEX in the City (Hall), or rather phone sex to be &shy;precise, was the hot topic of discussion at the Msunduzi executive committee (Exco) meeting yesterday.Councillor Bill Lambert produced a summons from a law firm demanding R1&thinsp;920 &ldquo;for services &shy;rendered by Our Way Adult Chatline&rdquo;.Lambert was appalled that the call was made from the reception desk of the Exco members&rsquo; suite of offices.&ldquo;I cannot believe these sultry online chats to some adult person on the other end was made from our &shy;offices. This goes beyond the pale. It is something so &shy;extraordinary that it goes &shy;beyond speech,&rdquo; he said.The summons said the call had been made in &shy;December 2013 and the lawyer &shy;demanded payment by Tuesday, November&thinsp;25 or else goods would be attached.Lambert has long complained about security breaches and this one had the senior councillor hot under the collar that steamy sex chat sessions were being &shy;allowed to take place in the hallowed city hall.Madeleine Jackson-Plaatjies, manager in the &shy;municipal manager&rsquo;s office, managed to cool the meeting down when she told Exco this was a scam.Jackson-Plaatjies said it had happened to her and she had received a similar &shy;notification demanding &shy;payment for a phone sex call. The number cited in the summons had been her &shy;secretary&rsquo;s phone and the call had apparently been made on a Saturday.She had written to the &shy;lawyer asking for the audio tapes of the call, but when they arrived they had been &shy;inaudible.Jackson-Plaatjies told the lawyer she would be taking legal action against them and said she never heard from them again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if they are doing this to other municipalities and &shy;government offices as well, who may be paying up to avoid a scandal,&rdquo; she added.She assured Lambert she would investigate.This was cold comfort for the councillor who was later heard discussing the matter with fellow Exco members during the tea break.Lambert had previously reported to Exco that he had arrived at his office on a &shy;Saturday morning and found a strange woman sitting at the executive suite&rsquo;s reception desk involved in an animated conversation. The Witness also previously reported Lambert&rsquo;s travel wallet and the Exco secretary&rsquo;s handbag had been stolen from the &shy;office suite.&bull; nalini@witness.co.za24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
