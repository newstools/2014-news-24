However, all the evidence suggests that he is resisting belt-tightening measures in the defence force," Maynier said."In the end, it's simply wrong, for General Solly Shoke to spend a fortune in international travel when ordinary soldiers, serving on the frontline, do not have the equipment they require to properly execute their mission because of budget constraints." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
