AFP reported in 2011 that Suleman was so well known in the southern African country that most Mozambicans just called him MBS. But Washington called him a drug lord, abetted by "endemic corruption" in this country that risked becoming Africa's newest narco-state. US President Barack Obama put Suleman on a list of specially designated narcotics traffickers and barred Americans from doing business with him. Companies linked to Suleman - Grupo MBS Limitada, Grupo MBS-Kayum Centre and Maputo Shopping Centre, were sanctioned after he was added to the Obama administration list of international drug kingpins.
