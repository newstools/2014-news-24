Swazi national Sanele Goodness May, whose truck ploughed into six vehicles at a busy Durban intersection killing 24 people last year, will spend the next eight years and 10 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to 31 charges in the Durban High Court.However, with good behaviour he could be released in six years.The charges were read out to him in isiZulu and through an interpreter he told Judge Kate Pillay: I admit all the charges. He was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for each of the culpable homicide convictions, with five years suspended.He was also sentenced to one year for violating the immigration laws and four years for each of the traffic and licence violations.All the sentences are to run concurrently and the 14 months May has been in custody were taken into account. The effective sentence is one of eight years and 10 months. With good behaviour that could be reduced by a third or more, said Pillay.She said she believed May was remorseful and had demonstrated contrition for his actions .May s efforts to secure employment without a valid licence had set a chain of events in motion that were tragic despite his noble intentions to support his younger brother in Swaziland. The accused too did not emerge unscathed. He has had to sit in jail more than a year awaiting his fate. Pillay said the court took notice of the fact that drivers used Fields Hill to avoid paying toll fees.The accident highlighted the need for truck owners to verify the details and licences presented to them by prospective employees.She urged traffic authorities to step up their policing on Fields Hill.In his plea agreement, read into the record by his advocate Louis Barnard, May admitted he knew his driving permits were not legitimate and he had misrepresented to his employer Sagekal Logistics that they were valid.It also emerged from the agreement that May had failed an initial driving test with the company two weeks prior to his employment on September 2 2013.The fateful trip, during which he lost control of his vehicle down Fields Hill, was his first for the company.He had taken a load up to Joburg and it was on his return trip to Durban that he lost control of the truck.May kept his head down when press photographers tried to take pictures of him before he entered the dock.On entering the dock a small group of supporters waved to him.As he left the dock after being sentenced a woman shouted from the public gallery: We love you Sanele. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
