AN abandoned baby found clinging to life in a bush in Westville is beating all the odds. Two weeks after being brought to the King George V Hospital after he was found by a tree cutter, baby Thabo has medical ­personnel at the hospital eating out of his tiny hand and is well on the road to recovery. His doctor, Romola Naidoo, said the baby was admitted in a very sick, septic, swollen and badly bruised condition. “He was so unstable that in the first three days we thought that he was not going to make it,” she said. “There was a huge question about whether he needed to be put into ICU, so we were quite aggressive and proactive with his ­management.” Thabo was immediately put on a machine to help him with his breathing. “Because he was born premature, his lungs were not fully developed and he was bleeding excessively from his skin, so he was given ­Vitamin K.” He was also anaemic and had jaundice. Naidoo said although having such a ­traumatic start to his life, Thabo, like his name suggests, is very happy. “He is not at all restless, very easily ­consolable and does not cry much. “He really is a strong little guy who really gets a lot of attention from the nurses. “All children who do not have parents are extra special and they get spoilt a bit more. There is no mom to carry them and hug them, so the nurses do that more often for them.” Naidoo said Thabo would be in the hospital for the next few weeks still and until he is placed or adopted. She appealed to the people that if they did not want a child, to leave it at the hospital or somewhere that is noticeable. “At least give the child a chance. When they are left out in the cold, their temperatures drop, which effects their lungs, blood glucose levels, lungs and brains.” • raisa.soodyal@witness.co.za
