Rescue teams are searching for other survivors trapped under the rubble and several surrounding buildings have been evacuated.The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorised to speak on the record, said the collapse was caused by unauthorised construction of several extra stories on the old building.Building collapses are common in Egypt, where shoddy construction is widespread in shantytowns, poor city neighbourhoods and rural areas. With a housing shortage and lax government oversight, developers seeking bigger profits frequently build without authorisation or permits. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
