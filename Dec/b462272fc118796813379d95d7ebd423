Kinshasa - Angry youths went on the rampage setting fire to government buildings after the death of at least 30 people in a boat accident in north-east Democratic Republic of Congo, officials said on Friday. "There are 105 survivors and we have pulled up 30 bodies," provincial government spokesperson Monulphe Bosso told AFP. The accident occurred Monday near a village some 35km north of the eastern provincial capital of Kisangani. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
