Raisa SoodyalA MICROPREMATURE baby girl born at 660&thinsp;grams would normally perish soon after being born, but she proved them wrong.Nozibusiso Gabela, also known as Gabby to the nurses, was born on March&thinsp;9 at just 24 weeks and severely premature. She spent 171 days in &shy; the neonatal intensive care unit (Nicu).Sister Marlene Naidoo, Nicu manager at the Richards Bay &shy;Netcare&rsquo;s The Bay Hospital, said babies that are born at this gestational age only have a 50% to 66% chance of surviving.&ldquo;Miraculously she survived the life threatening complications associated with micropremature birth,&rdquo; said Naidoo. &ldquo;Now, nearly 10 months later, she is a beautiful and blossoming baby girl.&ldquo;Micropremature infants are at a greater risk to develop short- and long-term complications. &ldquo;These include breathing difficulties due to an immature respiratory system, cardiovascular &shy;disorders, a compromised immune system, &shy;hearing and vision difficulties, and neurological problems.&ldquo;Not all premature babies experience complications. Generally, the earlier a baby is born and the lower the birth weight, the higher the risk of complications,&rdquo; she added.Naidoo said that saying goodbye to Gabby was a bittersweet moment. &ldquo;We are happy to be a part of this little fighter&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;Gabby is healthy, happy and a good 3,95&thinsp;kg &shy;according to her mom, Sibonisiwe Gladness &shy;Gabela.Gabela said when she first laid eyes on her new-born baby girl at the hospital, she was horrified.&ldquo;She was barely the size of my hand, I was scared to hold her and afraid for her life.&ldquo;After she was born, I did not return to hospital for three days and then I thought, how can I neglect my child and returned to find her just as small.&rdquo;Gabela said that her fragile child was very sick and tiny when she was born.&ldquo;I used to travel three hours from Nongoma to see her every day, I was so afraid that I could hardly sleep.&rdquo;The mother said that she feared for the life of her child.&ldquo;There were many times the nurses believed that she would not make it and they told me to pray and that God would help us.&ldquo;They encouraged me to hold and speak with her and that made her a little fighter, she became stronger.&rdquo;Gabela said Gabby now loves eating and playing with her toys.&ldquo;She really wants to crawl so she is trying,&rdquo; she said.&bull; raisa.soodyal@witness.co.za24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
