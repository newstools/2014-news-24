Newly-elected Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema is getting married, he's just not saying so.Malema told journalists at a media briefing following the close of the EFF's three-day national people's assembly in Bloemfontein today that it was a private function, after one journalist congratulated him on his upcoming wedding.About an hour earlier Malema told the more than 2000 delegates in the conference hall during his closing speech: "There is an arrangement which the leadership will whisper to you in January which I'm going to be engaged in privately this December so that I represent you very well. I won't tell you what. I'm saying it's a private function. Let me go and rest and have my private arrangement," he said to women ululating."You must wish me well in your villages and everywhere because it is a very small function," he said to laugher by delegates, "it is for closed family members because fighters we are too many and we cannot accommodate all of you."It has been reported that Malema is set to marry Mantwa Matlala, a woman from his home town Seshego.Malema also told City Press that he wanted to have more children to perpetuate his revolutionary ideas.Malema in his closing speech also told fighters to go and rest because it has been a long year for them, starting with their protests at President Jacob Zuma's Nkandla home and ending with their national people's assembly.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
