A broad array of groups signed a unity agreement last week that they hoped would strengthen the negotiating position of the SPLM-N.But the government warned political leaders would pay a price for tying their fate to the rebels, and arrested two of them days after the deal."The government is not serious about the national dialogue and is just buying time for the re-election of a president who is wanted by the International Criminal Court," said Yasir Arman, secretary-general of the SPLM-N, in a reference to the ICC's indictment against Bashir for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity."The regime has no solutions for the two areas except war and starvation," Arman said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
