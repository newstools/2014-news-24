	     Johannesburg - Three men appeared in the Blue Downs
Magistrate's Court on Monday in connection with the murders of six Kraaifontein
men, Cape Town police said. Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said the case against the
men, aged 25, 28 and 44, was postponed to 24 February. This brought the total to 13 people charged with the
murders. On 23 December, the National Prosecuting Authority said a
total of 10 people had been charged. "Each is facing six counts of premeditated
murder," NPA regional spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said at the time. Those accused would now spend the festive season behind
bars at Pollsmoor Prison after the matter was postponed in the Bluedowns
Magistrate's Court until 24 February for bail applications. "The State will oppose bail," said Ntabazalila. On 9 December, the bodies of six men, aged between 18 and
30, were found by passers-by at Joostenberg Vlakte, near Kraaifontein. The men were found lying face down with their hands tied
behind their backs and appeared to have been stoned to death. Subsequently, on 17 December, eight men were arrested in
connection with the crime. However, during previous court proceedings, charges
against one of the accused were dropped due to insufficient evidence.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
