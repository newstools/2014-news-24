Ingrid OellermannTHIRTY-TWO-YEAR-OLD Thenjiwe Griffiths was jailed for life yesterday for the 2006 murder of her husband, Allan (60).She was also sentenced to 15 years&rsquo; imprisonment for robbery with aggravating circumstances of his car, which was taken from him when he was killed.Judge Rishi Seegobin said he was obliged by law to impose these sentences on Thenjiwe after finding no compelling circumstances to justify lesser terms.Thenjiwe had exercised her constitutional right to maintain her innocence and in so doing, rejected the court&rsquo;s judgment that she was guilty. &ldquo;The fact that she maintains her innocence also means that there is no need for her to show remorse. Indeed she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the judge said.Allan was found strangled in long grass along a district road near Colenso on January&thinsp;20, 2006.The court rejected Thenjiwe&rsquo;s evidence that she and her husband were victims of a hijacking. The judge said the only reason that Thenjiwe married her husband, who was much older and an alcoholic, was for material gain. Soon after he&rsquo;d taken steps to divorce her, and also obtained a protection order against her, he went missing.His sister, Carolyn Riddle, filed a missing persons report in November 2005.Passing sentence yesterday, Seegobin said Griffiths did not deserve to die in this fashion. &ldquo;He was an old man living out the last years of his life in retirement &hellip; This type of offence fills society with revulsion. Courts can do no more than ensure that people who commit such offences are severely punished,&rdquo; he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
