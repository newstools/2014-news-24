Their job was to make sure departments tasked with spending public money were kept on their toes and followed the rules. By [bowing to pressure], you re shaking off those that might want to continue doing funny things in the financial books because they know the audit is just going to select a certain number of transactions at the end of the year and might miss the ones they dealt with. So we are putting pressure on them in an indirect way, to say We re watching you , said Makwetu, who lives in Joburg.He s not pleased that his team s work spending lots of time with both administrators and politicians, showing them what the law allows and how good financial governance is done has translated into only a handful of good examples. We have been throughout the country, in between audits, to sensitise the political heads and accounting officers on some of the basic systems of accounting disciplines and controls, Makwetu said. We ve done that over the years and still the audit outcomes are not really a reflection of people who have acted on our advice. He may not be cracking open the Champagne, but Makwetu is hopeful things can change.He wants better accountability from political leaders and administrators, and aims to turn around poor performance in the coming years. Our aspiration over the next 10 years is to see a public sector characterised by credible and transparent financial reporting. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
