"You are sentenced... in respect of count one [to] life imprisonment," Justice John Hlophe told Coetzer. Coetzer was sentenced to 15 years in prison for robbery with aggravating circumstances. This term would run concurrently with the murder sentence. On Friday, Coetzer was convicted of strangling Bronn to death in his Sea Point, Cape Town, home on 6 February 2012. Coetzer's two co-accused, Fareez Allie and Achmat Toffa, were acquitted on the murder and robbery charges. Toffa was convicted on a lesser charge of theft, because he benefited from the sale of some of Bronn's possessions after the murder. He was fined R2 000. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
