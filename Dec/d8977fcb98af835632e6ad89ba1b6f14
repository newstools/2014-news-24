The two-day ceremony reportedly started on Saturday at the bride's house in Malema's neighbourhood of Seshego Zone 1 outside Polokwane, and ended at Malema's grandmother's house on Sunday. Despite strict security at the start of the wedding, The Star reported that security was relaxed by Sunday, and ordinary people were allowed through the security checkpoint, but were not allowed into the marquee. Some were even given free beer. According to City Press, the wedding was not a typical township wedding, with a luxury air-conditioned marquee and plenty of expensive cars parked outside. Three guests even arrived by helicopter.Guests included EFF chairperson Dali Mpofu, lawyer Tumi Mokwena, actress Lerato Moloi, former Limpopo premier Cassel Mathale and former Limpopo MECs Pinky Kekana and Clifford Motsepe. Notably absent were two of Malema's closest friends, Collins Foromo and Jacob Lebogo, after they reportedly fell out over money. Malema has had a busy year since being elected to Parliament in May. Earlier in December, Malema was nominated unopposed as EFF president. He also received an extension to pay off the R4m he owes to the South African Revenue Service, staving off a provisional sequestration order until March 2015. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
