	     Johannesburg - A domestic worker has been arrested after a woman was killed and her home robbed at a Midrand complex, Gauteng police said on Friday. The 27-year-old woman was due to appear in the Randburg Magistrate's Court shortly, said Warrant Officer Moses Maphakela. Police were searching for three men believed to be her accomplices. Maphakela said three men entered the Vorna Valley complex on Thursday and knocked on the door of one of the units. "The owner opened the door and three suspects got inside," he said. A domestic worker employed there was forced to go into a room while the flat owner was held at gunpoint and her home ransacked. The robbers took an iPhone, two laptops and a safe with a firearm inside. Maphakela said the owner was strangled before the men fled. "Follow up investigations led to the arrest of the domestic worker and the two [stolen] laptops were found in an informal settlement in Tembisa," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
