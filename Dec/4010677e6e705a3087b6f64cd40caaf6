The Egyptian embassy, therefore, will have to explain how the child left the country," said Bolhuis.The Egyptian embassy said they were aware of the case, adding that they received the mother&rsquo;s complaint at the beginning of December and met her last week."Since then we have been following the case with the Egyptian Authorities in order to reach the father and investigate the matter," said the embassy in a statement.Marital problems and uneasinessThe embassy said it asked the mother for additional information about the father of her son &ldquo;particularly how the father can be reached in Egypt as well as a copy of his passport and the child&rsquo;s passport&rdquo;. &nbsp;When&nbsp; the mother "failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; provide&nbsp; a&nbsp; copy&nbsp; or&nbsp; the&nbsp; passport&nbsp; number&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; child,&nbsp; we checked his name on our visa system for the last three months and among our visa application forms, and we couldn&rsquo;t find the child details on our system or any application form bearing his details,&rdquo; read the statement.The embassy denied it had not been co-operative in giving information as the Specialised Security Services had "not met with anyone of us at the embassy".According to Bolhuis, an accumulation of marital problems and uneasiness between the father and the mother could have prompted the father to "kidnap" the child.Bolhuis said although his team had managed to talk to the mother and other family members about the issue, they had not been able to talk to the father yet.Bolhuis said the investigations were still underway, adding that anyone with information pertaining to the case could contact him on +00 27 82447 6116 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
