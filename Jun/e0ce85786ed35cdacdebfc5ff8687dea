The rabbis in our country are fine people and great leaders. It is through their leadership that I have been encouraged? ?to write this letter. Opert would not say why he chose to blackmail Suiza or why he had demanded exactly R48?000.He told City Press that his real motivation was an intracommunal matter and then referred the newspaper to the chief rabbi of South Africa.Chief Rabbi Warren Goldstein refused to comment on Opert s behaviour, saying only that there is a moral duty to deal in an uncompromising and principled way with any corruption or wrongdoing by public officials .Goldstein said he also wanted to emphasise that the rumours about Rabbi Suiza having consorted with prostitutes were based on fabrications and are without any foundation whatsoever . And, said Goldstein, at no stage did the chief rabbi or the head of the beth din (the rabbinical law court) have any contact or communication withthe National Prosecuting Authority or the SA Police Service. The criminal justice system was left to take its own independent course under the direction of the state prosecutor. Rabbi Suiza said his wife was traumatised by the incident and it had been a very sad event for all concerned .24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
