votes of last week's parliamentary election and publish final results, the
elections commission said on Saturday. On Wednesday, the North African state elected a new assembly
in a vote marred by a low turnout and violence, opening a new chapter in
Libya's bumpy transition toward democracy since the 2011 fall of Muammar
Gaddafi to an armed uprising. "We are expecting to announce the final results in
mid-Ramadan," said Emad Sayeh, head of the High National Election
Commission. He was referring to the holy Muslim fasting month that starts on
Sunday. The commission published partial results from some cities
but Sayeh said more time was needed to count votes and produce accurate
results. Fewer than half of eligible Libyans voted, a paltry turnout
reflecting disillusion with the chaos prevailing since Gaddafi's overthrow. The oil producer is in chaos as the government and outgoing
parliament have failed to produce security and curb militias who helped oust
Gaddafi but now defy state authority.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
