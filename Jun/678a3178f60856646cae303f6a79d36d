CrackdownEdwards told AFP the drop in arrivals in Yemen appeared linked, among other things, to a shift in migration patterns towards North Africa and Libya because of unrest in Yemen and a crackdown in Saudi Arabia on illegal migration. "Over the past five years, more than half a million people, mainly Somalis, Ethiopians and Eritreans, have crossed the dangerous waters of the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea to reach Yemen," he said."Boats are overcrowded and smugglers have reportedly thrown passengers overboard to prevent capsizing or avoid detection," he added, pointing out that search-and-rescue officials estimate this has resulted in hundreds of undocumented deaths in recent years.Yemen has taken in up to two million refugees, mostly illegal migrants, according to unofficial estimates in Sanaa."Each refugee costs the Yemeni state an average of around 2 300 dollars a year," researcher Mustapha Nasr, who runs a Sanaa-based economic data centre, told AFP.Thousands of migrants, many trying to reach Europe, have died in other tragedies at sea in recent years.UNHCR said on Friday it was "working to prevent the alarming loss of life at sea and indifference to people desperately needing protection.""We are reiterating our call for governments in the region to strengthen their search-and-rescue capacities," Edwards said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
