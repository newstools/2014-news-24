"Now we're in a race against time trying to restore morals."Pious Muslims spend longer times at the mosques during the month, which they devote to prayer, charity and good deeds.The measure is the latest attempt by the state to control religious speech following last year's overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi. In recent months Egypt has banned Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, which it declared a terrorist organisation, and passed a new law restricting protests.The ministry had already restricted preaching in mosques to state-authorised clerics.In a separate development, a Cairo appeal court has set 22 July as the date of a retrial for a prominent Egyptian activist sentenced to 15 years in prison in absentia for organising an unauthorised protest and assaulting a policeman.The sentencing of Alaa Abdel-Fattah and 24 others was the latest blow to liberal activists at a time of rapidly eroding freedoms.The sentence was the toughest against any of the secular activists behind the 18-day uprising that ended the reign of longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011. It is also the first conviction of a prominent activist since former army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi took office.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
