Plans are that the hospital will be accessible to patients from KZN, the Free State and Mpumalanga.Plans were revealed last week by the new KZN premier Senzo Mchunu who said the state would provide the land and the infrastructure will be provided by the University of Manipal &ndash; a well known university in India.Mchunu said the university would solve two issues &ndash; the shortage of medical-training spaces and that of quotas adding that there will be nothing stopping white parents sending their children to the university should they be able to do so. He said it would also address the concerns of Indian people in the country, who also struggle to get their children into medical school.With this partnership, anyone who wants to study medicine and can afford to do so can study in South Africa, he added.Meanwhile, Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande announced in May that a new health and allied sciences university would open its doors in Gauteng next year. He said the new university would be merged with the Medical University of Southern Africa (Medunsa) campus in Garankuwa, Pretoria and that the Medunsa campus would be separated from the University of Limpopo.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
