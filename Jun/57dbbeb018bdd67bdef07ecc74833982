THE CEO of a charitable organisation that is assisting a family left destitute after a fire last week, has decided to take on the con artists who are now preying on them. Mohammed Suleman, his wife and two children survived the fire that gutted their home, killing six members of a family who were tenants, and their domestic worker. The incident took place in Kharwastan, Chatsworth on Friday morning. ABH CEO Rajesh Lutchman yesterday said he had managed to speak to at least one of the group of people who were collecting donations on behalf of the Sulemans. “I appealed to the person to allow us to handle the matter because Mr Suleman and his family were taken care of. The man confirmed to me that he won’t be collecting any donations after our conversation. What’s important is that he has stopped. I couldn’t get hold of the other collectors but I hope that they got the message,” said Lutchman. When contacted, the man, whose name is known to The Witness, said he was a resident in the area and that he had decided to “get the ball rolling” after the incident. “For me it was one way of reaching out because I know Mohammed and while his father was still alive, we used to gather at their house and we used to play music. “By Friday morning when this happened ABH had not taken a decision on what will happen to Mohammed and his family so I started asking for donations. I have since delivered those blankets and have taken the shoes back to the shop because they were not fitting,” said the man. Lutchman said he had no knowledge of the delivery and urged people not to collect donations on behalf of the ABH and the family. He urged anyone who wanted to assist the family to contact the ABH. — Witness Reporter.
