Niger police arrested Anfani's editor in chief Abdoul-Razak  Idrissa, and two journalists, Haoua Maigari and Moussa Hassane  on Wednesday. "They are being held in detention and I think this is linked  to an interview they conducted with a union leader from the  education sector," Gremah Boukar, director-general of Anfani,  told Reuters. The union leader, Ismael Salifou, has also been detained. Police sources, who asked not to be identified, said the  union leader is accused of making insulting remarks about the  president and inciting ethnic hatred during the interview  broadcast on 22 January. The journalists are being held as his accomplices, the  police sources said. Political tensions have risen in Niger since August, after a  reshaping of Issoufou's ruling coalition that saw National  Assembly leader Hama Amadou enter the opposition. Since late January, six journalists, two politicians and a  member of civil society have been briefly detained on charges  including slander, inciting ethnic hatred and plotting against  state security. They have all subsequently been released. "Niger is witnessing a decline in freedom of the press. We  will fight until our comrade Ismael Salifou is freed," Salou  Yacouba, spokesperson for the national association of education  workers, told journalists.
