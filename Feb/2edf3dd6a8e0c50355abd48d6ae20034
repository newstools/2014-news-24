Reports say current humanitarian crises in Africa, for example in South Sudan and Central African Republic, make it difficult for WFP to tackle the long-term problem of hunger in Zimbabwe. This comes at a time when an estimated 2.2 million people in Zimbabwe face hunger and are in urgent need of food aid due to poor harvest last season. According to newzimbabwe.com, the UN agency has so far only managed to receive about half of the $85m needed to feed starving Zimbabweans. WFP country representative Sory Ouane said her organisation had only managed to assist 1.2 million people out of the targeted 1.8 million. Ouane said the 1.2 million people had only been assisted with half of what her organisation had planned to give them. A Deutsche Welle? report says food shortages have plagued Zimbabwe since 2000 when agricultural production decreased dramatically. The government of President Robert Mugabe, however attributes this to drought. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
