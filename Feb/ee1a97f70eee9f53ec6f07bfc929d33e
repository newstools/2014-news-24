State media reported on Wednesday that local government minister Ignatius Chombo said the money will be used to provide shelter, food and pay for the hire of helicopters ferrying stranded villagers living in the Tokwe-Mukosi Dam flood basin.

Continuous heavy downpours countrywide have affected the dam. Images in the state media show the dam wall is leaking and fears are that if it bursts, an 18-metre wall of water could come gushing downstream. However, Zimbabwean MDC Senator and former minister of education, sport, arts and culture, David Coltart, tweeted on Wednesday that fears of the dam wall being washed away have been laid off as the emergency spill way has been blasted. Engineers on the site indicated that 'there is no chance of [the] wall washing away" and while the situation may look dire to outsiders, it is under control, he wrote on his facebook page. - AP and News24 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
