Mugabe turned 90 on Friday and a $1m birthday bash to be attended by liberation movements from the SADC region is set to be held at a stadium in Marondera. According to a Beeld report Bona s wedding is set to a cost almost R50m with transport expenses alone pegged between R3m and R4m. Bona, 24, is expected to tie the knot with pilot Simba Chikore at Mugabe s mansion in Borrowdale on 1 March, while Mugabe s birthday celebrations are set for Marondera on 23 February. The report said a wealthy SA diamond dealer was involved in the arrangements, adding everyone had to sign secrecy agreements in a bid to prevent details leaking out. Meanwhile, Harare residents have reportedly been incensed by reports that government has spent over $1m to upgrade roads linking Zimbabwe s state house to Mugabe s private home. This comes as most roads in the city are riddled with potholes, some of which now resemble craters as council is failing to provide essential services due to cash constraints. It is not clear, however, whether Mugabe who is in Singapore for a medical operation would be back in the country in time for his birthday celebrations. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
