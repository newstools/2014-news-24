Johannesburg - South Africa was the first country to
include no discrimination based on sexual orientation in its Constitution,
Judge Edwin Cameron said on Friday. "We became the very first country in April 1994...
that included two crucial words in our Constitution and the words were sexual
orientation and our equality clause contains the prohibition against unfair
discrimination regarding sexual orientation," he told a discussion at the
University of Johannesburg. "No other country in the world has done that." There were many forms of discrimination not just race and
gender. Cameron said it was a difficult but vital issue which
needed to be discussed. "It's an issue that's not only important to the
vulnerable among us, it's not only important for that self-identifying
same-sex-orientated woman in a township who's at risk from some of her
neighbours," he said. "It's important to all of us because this question
of sexual orientation goes throughout humanity." South Africa was carrying a light on the continent where
there were terrible things happening. Cameron referred to Uganda and Nigeria's stance on sexual
orientation. He said how the issue was confronted institutionally,
nationally, and constitutionally determined how people related to their own
humanity. Cameron, who is a Constitutional Court judge, is an
openly HIV positive gay man and activist.
