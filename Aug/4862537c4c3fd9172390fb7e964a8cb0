They are influenced by old age and environmental stress, such as exposure to tobacco smoke or alcohol.Pharmaceutical companies are hugely interested in drugs that can "fix" malfunctioning epigenes - more than 78 epigenetic therapy drugs are being devised for cancer alone. Other big disease targets are diabetes and Alzheimer's.Elgin said drug designers had to take care these novel therapies did not perturb epigenetic machinery across the human genetic code, inflicting a knock-on effect in a way similar to chemotherapy.Testing theories on model organisms like the humble fruitfly first could be a big help, she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
