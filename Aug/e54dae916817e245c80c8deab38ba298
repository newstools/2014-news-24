Johannesburg - The case against a man accused of a road rage assault in Fourways has been postponed to next month in the Randburg Magistrate's Court. Gregory Kleinhentz appeared briefly on Thursday facing charges of assault and malicious damage to property. The case was postponed to 11 September for further investigation. He allegedly attacked a motorist on Witkoppen Road in July. The incident was recorded by an eyewitness and posted on YouTube. The video shows a passenger, believed to be Kleinhentz, getting out of a Porsche and kicking the driver's side of a VW Jetta. When the Jetta driver rolls down the window, the accused allegedly starts to punch him. A struggle ensues and he grabs what appears to be the Jetta keys and throws them away.
