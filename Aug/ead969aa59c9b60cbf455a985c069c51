Johannesburg - Lesbians are at particular risk of
anti-women violence, Judge Edwin Cameron said on Friday. "Anti-lesbian violence is a specific form of
anti-women violence because lesbians challenge men to rethink gender
conceptions," he told a discussion on sexual orientation at the University
of Johannesburg. "But all women, too many women in South Africa and
too many children [are at risk]... we have a long way to go." Cameron was responding to the murder of an 18-year-old
girl who was raped and murdered earlier this month in Ventersdorp in the North
West. It was reportedly believed to be "corrective
rape" because the woman was a lesbian. Cameron said more public spokespersons were needed on the
protection of women and advocating against violence, but also advocating for
same-sex orientation. Cameron, a Constitutional Court judge, is an openly HIV
positive, gay man.
