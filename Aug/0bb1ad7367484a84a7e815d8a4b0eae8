Johannesburg - A man accused of a road rage assault in Fourways north of Johannesburg, is expected to appear in the Randburg Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Gregory Kleinhentz allegedly attacked a motorist on Witkoppen Road in July. The incident was recorded by an eyewitness and posted on YouTube. The video shows a passenger getting out of a Porsche and kicking the driver's side of a VW Jetta. When the Jetta driver rolls down the window, the other man starts to punch him. A struggle ensues and the man grabs what appear to be the Jetta's keys and throws them away. Kleinhentz first appeared on 30 July and the case was postponed for further investigation.
