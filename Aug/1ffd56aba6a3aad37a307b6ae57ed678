He had opened an attempted murder case before his death."It will be alleged that accused two secreted the police dockets concerning the attempted murder of Alice Manana and the kidnapping of Oupa, in the safe in his office at the Vosloorus police station, to ensure that no further criminal investigations and/or criminal prosecutions would be instituted against him," according to the charge sheet.Earlier on Monday, Mdluli was formally charged in court, and his case was postponed to 7 October.He faces charges including kidnapping, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, intimidation, and defeating the ends of justice.Other charges against Mdluli were reinstated earlier this year after the Supreme Court of Appeal upheld a high court ruling against the withdrawal of fraud and corruption charges against him.This was after Freedom Under Law sought an order in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria to set aside the decisions and reinstate the charges against him.Mdluli was suspended amid allegations of fraud and corruption, and charges relating to Ramogibe's death in 1999.Murder, kidnappingIn the Boksburg Magistrate's Court, Mdluli and three others were initially accused of killing Ramogibe, intimidation, kidnapping, assault with grievous bodily harm, attempted murder, and conspiracy to commit murder.The fraud and corruption charges, meanwhile, relate to a different time in Mdluli's life - in his capacity as head of the crime intelligence unit.He is accused of employing family members and friends as intelligence operatives, and misusing police funding to buy luxury cars.The fraud and corruption charges were withdrawn on 14 December 2011, and in March 2012, Mdluli was reinstated as head of crime intelligence.A month later, the NPA provisionally withdrew the murder charges, pending an inquest into the matter.In May that year, then police minister Nathi Mthethwa announced Mdluli would be transferred from crime intelligence to the office of the deputy national police commissioner for operations.Later, he was suspended for a second time when allegations emerged from the inquest into Ramogibe's murder. In November 2012, the inquest cleared him of any involvement in the murder. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
