Johannesburg - A man trampled to death by an elephant in Mapungubwe
National Park and World Heritage Site in Limpopo may have been part of an
illegal cigarette smuggling syndicate. Eyewitness News reported on Tuesday that police are
investigating the case. A SA National Parks (SANParks) official told EWN that a
number of people have been seen trespassing in the park, and others trading in
illegal cigarettes have passed through the park. The park is on the border of South Africa, Zimbabwe and
Botswana. On Monday, it was reported that the man was found with a
Zimbabwean passport and cellphone in his possession. Rangers believed he had been with a group of people because a
number of footprints were visible in the vicinity. Earlier this year it was reported that one in three
cigarettes smoked in the country each day is illegal. Since 2010, the
government has lost more than R18bn in taxes due to the illicit cigarette
trade. About 38% of these illegal cigarettes are smuggled into the
country from Zimbabwe, while the rest are manufactured locally.
