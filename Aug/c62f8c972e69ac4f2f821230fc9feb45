	     Johannesburg - A man was arrested for perjury after he
allegedly opened a false hijacking case in Fordsburg, Johannesburg police said
on Thursday. The 55-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday afternoon,
said police spokesperson Xoli Mbele. He opened the false hijacking case on Tuesday. "When the suspect was taken to the place where he
said he was hijacked, he changed his story and told the police that he was
scared that his boss will fight with him," said Mbele. "He was not supposed to be there and he opened a
false case of car hijacking instead of theft of motor vehicle." The man would appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate's
Court on Friday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
