	     Johannesburg - The use of the bucket toilet system
increased in three provinces between 2012 and 2013, according to a Statistics
SA report released on Thursday. The Eastern Cape, North West, and KwaZulu-Natal reported
increases, according to Stats SA's Non-Financial Census of Municipalities, June
2013. In North West, 1 481 households were using the bucket
toilet system in 2012. This increased to 1 750 in 2013. In KwaZulu-Natal, no households were using the bucket
system, but in 2013, 1 585 were using it, according to Stats SA. The number of households using the system in the Eastern
Cape increased from 38 606 to 52 732. The province had the highest number of
households using the bucket toilet system. DA MPL in the Eastern Cape, Nokonwaba Matikinca, said the
increase was shocking. "The bucket system is an assault on the dignity of
our citizens," she said in a statement. "It is unacceptable that people have to live in
contravention of Section 24 of the Bill of Rights in our Constitution which
states that 'everyone has their right to an environment that is not harmful to
their health or well-being'." According to Stats SA the number of households using the
bucket system decreased between 2012 and 2013 in Gauteng, Western Cape,
Northern Cape, and Free State. In Gauteng the number dropped from 160 to 58; in the
Western Cape it decreased from 3 804 to 2 598; Northern Cape decreased from 9 286
to 8 147, and the Free State went down from 35 214 to 31 032. Limpopo reported no use of the bucket toilet system in
2012 or 2013, Stats SA said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
