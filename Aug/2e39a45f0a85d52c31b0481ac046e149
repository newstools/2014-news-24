This makes the Jewish Board of Deputies complicit in the murder of the people in Gaza.The time has come to say very clearly that if a woman or child is killed in Gaza , then the Jewish board of deputies, who are complicit, will feel the wrath of the people of SA with the age old biblical teaching of an eye for an eye. The time has come for the conflict to be waged everywhere the Zionist supporters fund and condone the war killing machine of Isreal [sic].&rdquo;The Cosatu leader told News24 that he was &ldquo;completely against violence&rdquo; but wanted &ldquo;concomitant action&rdquo; taken against the board. Ehrenreich also denied that he was anti-Semitic.&ldquo;There should be relative steps taken against Israel,&rdquo; Ehrenreich said.&lsquo;Inflammatory post&rsquo;He said that he meant that more &ldquo;decisive action&rdquo; must be taken against those who support Israel&rsquo;s actions in the conflict.But the board said the &ldquo;inflammatory post&rdquo; does indeed incite violence and foments hatred against the elected representative spokesbody for the South African Jewish community and all those associated with it.&ldquo;This is [a] flagrant violation of South African legislation prohibiting hate speech, particularly that which constitutes incitement to cause harm,&rdquo; Sacks said.Sacks also said allegations that the board was funding the Israeli army and sending South African youths to fight in the war are &ldquo;baseless&rdquo;. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
