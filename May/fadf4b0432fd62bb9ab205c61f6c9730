Witness Reporter THERE is still no trace of the child who was snatched from a Home Affairs queue in Pietermaritzburg two weeks ago. The parents of six-week-old baby Olwethu are now starting to lose hope. The child’s father, Bonginkosi Mphemba (34), said, “I’m starting to lose hope about my child as no one seem to be helping — even the police.” He added that they had followed up on a call they received from people in Willowfountain claiming to have spotted an unidentified child. “But when we arrived the child was already moved to Estcourt” said Mphemba. Olwethu’s mother, Nonhlanhla Madlala (25), lost her baby when she went to the Home Affairs office to register the child’s birth. A woman approached her and offered to hold the baby while she was completing forms but then fled with the child. Police spokesperson Captain Thulani Zwane said the police were still searching for the baby. The father can be contacted at 079 405 6518 and the mother at 076 082 0125.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
