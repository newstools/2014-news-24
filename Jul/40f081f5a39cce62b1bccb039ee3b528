Hygiene promotion activities also stopped with the suspension of ICRC operations," OCHA said.An estimated 100 000 people in Jebel Marra have been severely affected or displaced by conflict, but aid workers have still not been able to access other parts of the district to confirm the situation.In May, the ICRC said the suspension of its activities in Sudan was having a severe impact as conflict worsened.Authorities accused the Geneva-based organisation of violating guidelines for working in Sudan.The suspension was one of many restrictions placed on foreign aid workers in Sudan, where humanitarians are struggling to meet the needs of more than six million people in Darfur and elsewhere.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
