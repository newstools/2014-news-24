President Jacob Zuma has authorised the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to investigate irregular expenditure by the KwaZulu-Natal provincial treasury on, among other things, the North Sea Jazz Festival in Durban. In June 2012, City Press reported on Durbanâ€™s fishy jazz deal. The SIU will also investigate allegations that treasury officials irregularly contracted a service provider for the municipal infrastructure intervention programme. The proclamation also pertains to allegations of wasteful, unauthorised or irregular spending by the treasury on the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board, and commemorating prisoners of war at St Helena. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
