With all their promises they have not even come here to pay at least an instalment and now I am responsible for paying my supplier.&rdquo;&ldquo;I took all of the goods from my supplier on good faith that he would be paid and now we are both in trouble, this is not a small bill we are talking about, it is almost worth a deposit on a property,&rdquo; he added.A source close to the investigation, who could not be named as he is not authorised to speak to the press, said the investigation of the docket had stalled.&ldquo;The docket was open by the owners of the club and statements were taken. Among the evidence gathered were signed slips from the establishment which total more than R83 000. It would appear that the owners and the two suspects are trying to resolve the matter on their own, with the former accepting payment promises from the latter.Gumede could not be reached for comment, despite repeated attempts to contact him.Threats Dlomo responded with vitriol and threats. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why they keep dragging me into this matter, it has nothing to do with me. I am not afraid of this guy [the club owner] and he persists in talking shit about me to everyone,&rdquo; he said.He conceded that he attended the function and helped organise it.&ldquo;I facilitated this function but I was never responsible for paying for it. We must go to court,&rdquo; he added.According to public documents, Gumede is the director of four companies in various phases of liquidation. He has close links with controversial convicted entrepreneur, socialite and self-proclaimed prince Sifiso Zulu. Dlomo has ties with well-known ANC millionaire businessman PG Mavundla of Greytown.ANCYL spokesperson Siboniso Duma could not be reached for comment.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
