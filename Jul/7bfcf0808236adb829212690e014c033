	     This shocking incident of road rage was captured in Johannesburg. Watch as a Porsche passenger causes damage to the fellow motorist's car, before assaulting the driver.WATCH Johannesburg - A man who allegedly assaulted a driver during a road rage attack in Fourways, Johannesburg, was arrested on Tuesday, Gauteng police said. "He was brought into the police station by his legal representative and was arrested," police spokesperson Balan Muthan said. The man was released on bail and would appear in the Randburg Magistrate's Court on Wednesday charged with common assault. YouTube The attack, on Witkoppen Road at around 15:00 on Saturday, was recorded by a witness and posted on YouTube. The video shows a passenger getting out of a Porsche and kicking at the driver's door side of a VW Polo. When the Polo driver rolls down the window, the other man starts to punch him. A struggle ensues and the man grabs what appear to be the Polo's keys and throws them away. Punched In an interview with broadcaster eNCA, the Polo driver - who asked to remain anonymous for fear of victimisation - said he was punched in the face. He said he opened a case of assault. "I was driving behind him and he was cutting off people left, right, and centre. So I went closer to see what kind of a Porsche it was and the passenger threw a can out the window at me," the man was quoted as saying. "Then he threw another can, and it hit my car. So I hooted, flipped him the finger and asked what the hell he thought he was doing. "He damaged my tracking device and stuffed up my side mirror. It all happened so fast I didn't even have a chance to think," the man said. - Were you there?  Send us your eyewitness accounts and photos. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
