Witness ReporterEZEMVELO KZN Wildlife yesterday announced that it had issued a &ldquo;no work, no pay&rdquo; ultimatum to employees who embarked on an illegal strike this week.The strike had effectively closed down Ezemvelo&rsquo;s head office at Queen Elizabeth Park on Monday and Tuesday, EKZNW communications manager Musa Mntambo said in a statement issued yesterday. He said the leaders of Hospersa and Nehawu unions to which the strikers belong, had distanced themselves from the wildcat strike.Ezemvelo&rsquo;s acting CEO, Siphiwe Radebe, said the strike was not only illegal but &ldquo;highly regrettable&rdquo; given that management and the unions were immersed in a negotiation process surrounding the &ldquo;migration&rdquo; or restructuring of staff throughout the organisation. He said strikers&rsquo; interpretation of the migration&rsquo;s salary proposals would seem to have caused the strike.&ldquo;This misunderstanding has resulted in striking staff wanting new salary scales to be implemented immediately.&ldquo;Management has subsequently appointed an independent consultant to offer assurance to management that their own interpretation of the &lsquo;migration process&rsquo; is correct. The outcome of this independent interpretation will be placed before the unions next Monday.&rdquo;Radebe added that there was &ldquo;no correlation&rdquo; between the strike and staff concerns about Ezemvelo paying R1,5&thinsp;million to refurbish Didima Lodge for the recent hosting of the KZN Cabinet and legislature.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
