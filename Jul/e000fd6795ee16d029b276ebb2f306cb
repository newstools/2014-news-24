It upheld the test results from the city's laboratory."The City of Tshwane recently received a blue drop score of 95% - which implies that the city is capable of sustaining a safe quality of water supply and will act responsibly when deviations in the tap water quality are detected," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
