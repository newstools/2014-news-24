Ration cutsRefugees there were in many cases left with rations of just 850 calories per day, compared to the recommended 2 100 calories adults should receive to remain healthy.The situation was not much better for some 150 000 refugees in Central Africa or in South Sudan, where supplies had also been cut by at least 50%, while another 338 000 refugees in Liberia, Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Ghana, Mauritania and Uganda had seen their rations dwindle up to 43%, the UN agencies said. In addition, a series of unexpected, temporary ration reductions, sometimes due to insecurity, had hit camps in several countries since early 2013, including Kenya, Ethiopia, the Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon. "The number of crises around the world is far outpacing the level of funding for humanitarian operations, and vulnerable refugees in critical operations are falling through the cracks," said Guterres. He warned that even small cuts to rations could spell disaster for already undernourished people, with the impact, especially on children, "immediate and often irreversible".Refugees hit by ration cuts were desperately looking for ways to put food on the table, with the crisis pushing more and more children to quit school to seek work and prompting families to marry off their girls at a younger age."Survival sex" prostitution by women and girls trying to raise money for food was also a growing problem, the statement said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
