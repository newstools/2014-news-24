Our government fully supports the commitment taken by our African leaders and calls upon African people, on the continent and in the diaspora, to give impetus to this continental move," said Landers.He said Agenda 2063 would drive Africa on a developmental trajectory."Agenda 2063, in essence, should be about the improvement of the lives of African people. It is about an African continent that is self-reliant, self-sustaining and at peace with itself and the world around it. A true story of African rising."The fundamentals to achieve these goals are already in place. Africa has seen unprecedented growth over the last decade. However, for this growth to have lasting benefits, it should be anchored by accelerated economic development," said Landers.The youth summit on Friday would be followed by other consultations, soliciting input from academia, women, business, civil society and the cultural sector.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
