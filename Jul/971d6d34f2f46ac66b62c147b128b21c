"It is really a question between the civilised and the barbarians."US Secretary of State John Kerry has likened the Ugandan law to anti-Semitic legislation in Nazi Germany.Opposition leader Kizza Besigye has accused the government of using the issue of homosexuality to divert attention from domestic problems such as corruption scandals or Kampala's military backing of South Sudan's government against rebel forces.But homophobia is widespread in Uganda, where American-style evangelical Christianity is on the rise.Gay men and women face frequent harassment and threats of violence. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
