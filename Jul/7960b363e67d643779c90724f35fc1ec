The news of the passing of Nobel laureate and writer Nadine Gordimer has visibly shaken Advocate George Bizos. I saw her two weeks ago. I knew that she was seriously ill and would not last for long, he said with tears in his eyes earlier today.The human rights lawyer praised Gordimer for her literary work. Their friendship spanned more than 50 years.In an article last year, Gordimer told how Bizos used to smuggle her letters to struggle icon Nelson Mandela when he was on Robben Island. We met in the middle 50s and she was writing her first book, which described our university life and the problems we faced. She was very socially conscious and a great, prolific writer. She was a very good friend to have, said Bizos.He said sometimes Gordimer used real-life events in her books, but because of her skill, no one knew. She sometimes used something that you know very well of but would never mention your name in the story, he said.Bizos has lost another close friend. It s another friend I have lost in the recent past: Arthur Chaskalson, Nelson Mandela, Nadine [Gordimer]. When you get to my age you know that one of these days the bell will toll for you too. We are not immortal, he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
