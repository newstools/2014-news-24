Westinghouse handed in a better tender in all aspects out of a commercial and technical point, at a lower price as well, Wolvaardt was quoted as saying.In court papers, he said Brown was misled by former acting Eskom chief executive Collin Matjila and chairperson of Eskom s tender committee Neo Lesela on August 15 when they briefed her on the decision of the board.Beeld reported that Wolvaardt asked in court papers that Westinghouse get access to all documents that made Eskom decide on Areva.It also asked for a preliminary order to prevent Eskom from finalising the contract with Areva and to forbid them from acting on contracts that had already been finalised.The urgent application would be heard in the South Gauteng High Court on Friday.The new generators were expected to be installed in 2018.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
