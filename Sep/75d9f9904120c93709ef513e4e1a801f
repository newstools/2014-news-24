Parts of Cameroon along the border area would also probably be overrun."In Maiduguri, where thousands of people have fled violence from across Borno, residents said they were preparing for the worst."We live in fear of a possible Boko Haram attack on Maiduguri because of the speed with which they are taking over towns and villages," said local man Babagana Kolo.Independent corroboration"Our concern is soldiers are not able to stop Boko Haram who take delight in killing people.Boko Haram has been blamed for thousands of deaths since 2009 but in recent weeks has changed tactics, shifting from indiscriminate and retaliatory hit-and-run attacks to seizing strategic territory.In a video obtained by AFP on 24 August, the group's leader Abubakar Shekau claimed that the town of Gwoza in Borno state was now part of an Islamic caliphate.The group is now thought to hold a number of towns in an arc running from the Lake Chad area of northeast Borno, around the eastern border with Cameroon, to the south of the state.It also reportedly holds at least one town in neigbouring Yobe and Adamawa states. Independent corroboration is impossible because of communication and travel difficulties while the government has officially denied ceding territory.Nigeria has repeatedly played up what it says is the regional aspect of the insurgency, blaming foreign fighters and overseas funding for the violence.But while some foreign mercenaries may form part of the guerrilla ranks and violence has spilt across borders, some analysts say a wider military response risked internationalising the conflict. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
