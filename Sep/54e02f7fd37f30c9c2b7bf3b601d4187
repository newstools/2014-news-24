Democratic polls During the rally, Ewanga had declared that "for us, he [Kabila] must go" by 2016, when presidential polls are due. "We say 'No' to an amendment of the constitution."Ewanga had been charged with inciting hatred, tribalism and contempt of the supreme magistrature, according to prosecution sources.Kabila, a young soldier, was first rushed into office in 2001 by Kinshasa politicians after the assassination of his rebel-turned-president father Laurent-Desire Kabila by a bodyguard during wartime.A large United Nations mission helped end the conflict and in 2006 played a major part in organising the first democratic polls in the former Zaire, which were broadly declared free and fair.Five years later, however, fresh elections took place in very different circumstances and sparked an outbreak of serious violence as the opposition cried massive fraud. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
