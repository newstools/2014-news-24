A "design defect" caused the disaster near the capital Cairo on Sunday, according to Gamal Al-Taruti, head of the interior ministry's public safety department. "The building did not meet construction standards", he told AFP. An initial investigation found that the accident was caused by the unauthorised construction of a third floor at the factory, a judicial source said on condition of anonymity. An entrepreneur involved in the construction was detained, while arrest warrants were issued for two others as well as the owners of the building, the source said. Such accidents are common in Egypt where many buildings are old and violations of construction laws are frequent. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
