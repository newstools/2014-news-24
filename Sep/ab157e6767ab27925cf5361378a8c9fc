The Cabinet announced the move on Monday.Egypt Air, the country's main airline, changed the local timing of several flights and advised passengers to arrive three hours early instead of the normal two in order to avoid any confusion, according to the state-run Al-Ahram daily.Egypt's most popular soccer team Al Ahly postponed a practice to next Friday in order to insure players got enough sleep, according to local daily El-Masry El-Youm. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
