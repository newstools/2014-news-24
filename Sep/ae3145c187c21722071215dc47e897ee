The court&rsquo;s Justice John O&rsquo;Keefe overturned the board&rsquo;s ruling.The judge said the IRB&rsquo;s ruling was &ldquo;puzzling&rdquo; and showed a &ldquo;serious misunderstanding of the law&rdquo;.The couple is being represented by the same lawyer who worked for Brandon Huntley, a white South African who also sought refugee status in Canada after claiming he had been assaulted by black South Africans.The board granted Huntley refugee status in 2009 but the decision was found to be "unreasonable" on judicial review.According to the Times, from 2006 to June 2014, 151 South Africans have applied for asylum but only 23 applications were accepted.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
