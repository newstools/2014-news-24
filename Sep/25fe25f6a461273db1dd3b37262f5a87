He was 28. He was buried at the city's Ferncliff Cemetery, until his exhumation earlier this year.However, Nakasa's nephew Dr Sipho Masondo said on Saturday that he rejected all claims of suicide.He said that he had been told the night before Nakasa's body was found on a New York pavement, that Nakasa had received a telephone call at Miriam Makeba's New York home where he was interviewing her.The next day on 14 July 1965, he was dead, without having completed the interview."I do not accept that he committed suicide. He was a victim of the cold war," said Masondo.Tsedu said the reburial of Nakasa showed that government and the media could work together.He praised Nakasa's sister Gladys Mazibuko for being unwavering in her love and efforts to bring Nakasa back.Nakasa's remains arrived at Durban's King Shaka International Airport last month.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
