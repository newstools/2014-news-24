A representative of the Workers Against Regression Union (War), Raymond Barties, said: "The 10 truck drivers employed by the company have blocked the gates and this is the second day that deliveries are being prevented from taking place." The employees alleged that they were not being paid overtime as required by labour law. "We have been told that there are two contracts...one that provides for certain overtime payments and one that does not," said Barties. Management was in talks over the dispute, EFR's general manager Linka Bester said. The company supplies more than 75 000 chickens per week to large retail chains, delis and restaurants.Truck driver Piet Kok said: "We will not leave before management meets our demands." "If their demands are not met we will mobilise our supporters and join the workers," she said.Grabouw police were on the scene and public order policing had been called in as reinforcements.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
