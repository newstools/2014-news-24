He said two more officials on Monday requested representation in the disciplinary hearings, bringing the total to 12.Naicker revealed his labour relations officer Roshan Lil-Ruthan would request postponements in all 12 cases on Tuesday, &ldquo;so we can receive and read the evidence brought by the employer&rdquo;.A report by the Special Investigating Unit (SUI) fingers the officials for breaching procurement procedures, but admits none of the employees benefitted financially for their alleged misconduct.While former public works directors-general are also facing charges, no politician has yet been charged or disciplined in the R246m overspending scandal.Nkandla filesOn Monday, the PSA held a meeting to discuss what Nkandla materials were on the laptop and whether it could have been targeted by unknown parties concerned about the employees&rsquo; testimony.One assistant told Naicker: &ldquo;They must have been after your Nkandla files.&rdquo;The Witness understands some stokvel money may also have been taken.However, Naicker said he was more sceptical, saying he considered an Nkandla-related motive for the crime a &ldquo;remote possibility - maybe a five percent chance&rdquo;.&ldquo;But you never know. If that&rsquo;s what it was about, that would be chilling,&rdquo; he said.He said: &ldquo;The first thing my staff said to me was: &lsquo;How much Nkandla material was on there?&rsquo; It was strange they only went to my office and only took my laptop and did not take the DVD player there or some liquor that was there from a previous party.&ldquo;Also, they went to a great deal of trouble to get in - we have a pretty immovable padlock; they had to go through a small glass pane. The reason I don&rsquo;t think it was connected is that there have been other break-ins in recently&rdquo;.Security concernsHe said some of the public servants represented by the PSA have expressed concerns about their personal security during the multi-week disciplinary process.Naicker&rsquo;s team interviewed the 12 public works employees last week, but said their interviews had not been downloaded to his laptop.Among them is project manager Jean Rindel - facing eight charges of misconduct. Like his colleagues, Rindel has denied all charges.While Lil-Ruthan has called his clients &ldquo;scapegoats&rdquo;, Naicker said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hesitant to use words like scapegoat or fall-guy - it may be an unfortunate case of a department wanting to be seen to be fully investigating a very public problem. But these charges are unfair - and they are already having a negative impact on these members and their families. The signs of stress and anguish are clearly visible; there is real concern about loss of jobs for people who have served the department diligently for decades in some cases.&rdquo;He said the laptop had held &ldquo;valuable information&rdquo;, but that much of it was &ldquo;personal&rdquo;.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
