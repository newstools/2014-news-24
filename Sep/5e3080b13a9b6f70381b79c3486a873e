Send us your eyewitness accounts and photos. Spokesperson William Mabasa said on Thursday fire-fighters have been trying to extinguished the flames since Friday, 12 September 2014.&ldquo;We are concerned about the hot weather conditions which we have been experiencing this week as they cause these fires to be difficult to control and can cause damage to the environment.&rdquo;SANParks said in a statement that a run-away fire jumped over the border on Friday from Mozambique into the Kruger National Park, burning areas south of Olifants River, Houtboschrand, N&rsquo;wanetsi until Tshokwane. &ldquo;However, it is now under control.&rdquo; Mabasa said that on Wednesday another fire had started from one of their concession areas on the western side of the park. &ldquo;Two fires started today around Phabeni Gate areas as well and are still raging&hellip; Our conservation staff members are working day and night to try and manage all the fires at the moment.&rdquo;The public has been advise to be on the look-out for fires in the park and to refrain from starting more, as the dry and windy conditions cause these fires to be &ldquo;fast, hot and out of control&rdquo;.&nbsp; Kruger National Park challenged by fires @ http://t.co/x4wBiamxHV pic.twitter.com/X0ACWzPunyTerrible catastrophy in Sabi Sands and Kruger.
