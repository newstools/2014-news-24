 "There has been a very big improvement," Ekurhuleni city spokesperson Themba Gadebe said on Thursday. "In Bedfordview and Primrose there is still a shortage of water because they are high-lying areas. We are struggling with them. But in all other areas, water has been restored." To help with the problem, Gadebe said water had been diverted from two other reservoir systems. He could not say when water supply would be back to normal in the two suburbs. Johannesburg Water spokesperson Millicent Kabwe said South Hills and Rabie Ridge were still without water. "In all other areas water has been restored. Every day and every hour the situation improves. I can't say when they will get water. I can't give an exact date and time." Rand Water spokesperson Justice Mohale said the level of water in its reservoirs had improved overnight. "The Meredale reservoir is at 41% today from yesterday's [Wednesday] late afternoon figure of 39%," he said. The Waterval reservoir was 39% full late on Wednesday, and by 06:00 on Thursday it was 47% full. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
