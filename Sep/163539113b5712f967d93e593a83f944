MAYIBONGWE MAQHINAON the surface DA MPL Mbali Ntuli appears pleased to be able to interact with her constituency this weekend.Yet, this is not a role she had wanted and instead it has been thrust upon her by her party.Two weeks ago, Ntuli stepped down as DA Youth leader under a cloud after she had been assigned the Umkhanyakude District as her constituency against her wishes.In an interview with The Witness yesterday, Ntuli said she was looking forward to her visit to the northern KwaZulu-Natal district.It would allow her to experience the culture and interact with the people she would be serving for the next five years, she said.The move has prompted some within the party to view her deployment to the rural area &mdash; where the party has no structures &mdash; as an attempt to set her up for failure.Ntuli told The Witness she was &ldquo;up to the task&rdquo;.&ldquo;I am fine with the interesting challenge. In fact, I&rsquo;m going for the first time to visit the constituency [Umkhanyakude District] to hold meeting with communities at grassroot levels this weekend,&rdquo; she said.Ntuli said her visit to the northern parts of the province would also take on a visit to the Reed Dance festival in Nongoma.&ldquo;I will go to the Reed Dance to understand the cultural dynamics, I look forward to it,&rdquo; said the enthusiastic Ntuli.Reacting to reports linking her to possibly challenging incumbent leader Senzo Mchunu in the next provincial congress, Ntuli said, &ldquo;I have not thought about it at the moment.&rdquo;However, she hastened to point it out that the move could pose an extra workload for her if she were to be the next leader.&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take the extra workload. That is a big task.&rdquo;It was reported this week some within the DA want her to contest Mchunu &mdash; or at least be the deputy leader.Ntuli, who was recently on two-month study fellowship in U.S., said the programme&rsquo;s experience and exposure had been invaluable.&ldquo;It was a great experience. I have made good contacts,&rdquo; she said.She added she planned to start her own empowerment projects geared towards the political training of future leaders and the empowerment of women.She hopes the community and women projects would start in the next two months and the future leaders in two years&rsquo; time.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
