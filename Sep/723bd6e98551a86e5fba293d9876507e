"Gambia's national assembly and the president should not endorse state-sponsored homophobia."Jammeh, a former military officer who seized power in a 1994 coup, brooks no dissent in a country often blasted by rights bodies for abuses and homophobia.He has repeatedly denounced homosexuality and once vowed to behead gays, although he later retracted the threat.Last year, Jammeh told the United Nations General Assembly that "those who promote homosexuality want to put an end to human existence"."It is becoming an epidemic and we Muslims and Africans will fight to end this behaviour," he said. Under current law, same-sex relationships are already punishable by up to 14 years in jail in Gambia.In 2012, 15 men were arrested in a popular bar and charged with "indecent practices in a public place" - a euphemism for homosexual acts.The president has two weeks to sign the proposals into law or return them for further review.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
