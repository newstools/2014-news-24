Rumana Akoob PEACE activist Paddy Kearney will be honoured with an eThekwini Living Legend by the city where he has tirelessly fought for equality. He is currently the project co-ordinator at the Denis Hurley Centre, housed at the Emmanuel Cathedral in the Durban CBD, from where they run a training programme for the homeless and unemployed and offering shelter to newly arrived refugees. Through their clinic they offer free medical care. Archbishop Denis Hurley, for whom the centre is named, was a stalwart anti-apartheid and social activist. Kearney moved to Glenwood in Durban from Pietermaritzburg almost 40 years ago. The annual Living Legends Awards forms part of the Municipality’s Heritage month celebrations and honours past and present residents of the City who have helped uplift communities. Kearney has worked with the Denis Hurley Centre since 2008. Before that he headed the Diakonia Council of Churches for close on 20 years. He said the award was a great honour and he was humbled by it. “The award is really about the work Diakonia and the Denis Hurley Centre has done which many have contributed to.” He is currently fundraising for the centre, which is being completely rebuilt with increased space at a cost of R31 million. Some 97% of funds have been secured through Kearney’s fundraising efforts. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
