Zuma had opposed the move.The recordings, internal memoranda, reports and minutes of meetings dealing with the contents of the recordings had to be provided.Charges droppedThe tapes, containing recorded phone conversations, allegedly reveal collusion between the former head of the Directorate of Special Operations (the now defunct Scorpions) Leonard McCarthy, and the NPA's former head Bulelani Ngcuka, to manipulate the prosecutorial process before the ANC's Polokwane conference in 2007.Zuma was elected ANC president at the conference. Former president Thabo Mbeki had been a contender for another term.The charges were dropped shortly before Zuma was sworn in as president in 2009. Then acting National Director of Public Prosecutions, Mokotedi Mpshe, said the tapes showed there was a political conspiracy against Zuma and so the case against him could not continue.On Monday, Zille said there was "sufficient evidence" on the recordings for a review application of the decision to withdraw corruption charges against Zuma."I have read the transcripts of the tapes handed to us by the NPA last Thursday. They constitute recordings of 36 conversations over five months," Zille said in the DA SA Today newsletter."Without revealing the contents, I am satisfied that the 'spy tapes' provide sufficient evidence to continue our review application of the decision, by the then acting National Director of Public Prosecutions Mokotedi Mpshe, to withdraw the charges against President Zuma."The DA's lawyers had advised it not to make public the contents of the tapes.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
