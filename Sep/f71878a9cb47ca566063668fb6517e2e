The blast was so strong most victims were unrecognisable to their relatives. Alberto Malo, a doctor at the hospital where several victims were brought, confirmed 2 Monday that two more people succumbed to their wounds.The mine appears to date to the country's fight for independence from Portugal. The blast has raised questions in Guinea-Bissau, which had declared itself free of all known land mines after demining operations.But Cesar de Carvalho, the director of country's centre for co-ordinating demining, said the area where the mine went off was not part of the programme since it was not the site of intensive fighting.Since independence in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has been roiled by coups and instability and no president has ever finished his term in office. It is now trying to get back on course, and held a peaceful presidential election in May.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
