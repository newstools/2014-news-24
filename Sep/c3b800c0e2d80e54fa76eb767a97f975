Comprehensive analysis "Based on this independent and comprehensive analysis, I have concluded that an investigation is warranted."The country plunged into conflict after a coup in March 2013 by a mainly Muslim rebel alliance, the Seleka, which overthrew president Francois Bozize and made their own man, Michel Djotodia, head of state.Influential foreign leaders in January forced Djotodia to step down after he proved incapable of preventing widespread atrocities by rogue Seleka fighters.Communities from Central Africa's mainly Christian majority responded by setting up vigilante forces known as "anti-balaka" (anti-machete) to seek vengeance, mostly targeting Muslim civilians whom they accused of backing Seleka.Bensouda said there was "a reasonable basis to believe that both the Seleka and the anti-balaka groups have committed crimes against humanity and war crimes".They include murder, rape, forced displacement, persecution and using child soldiers, she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
