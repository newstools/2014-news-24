The bus was cut in two," one survivor said.The blast was so powerful that the bodies of most of the victims were flung across nearby fields, some torn into pieces, he added.The injured were taken to the country's largest hospital, with ambulances shuttling to and from the site of the explosion late into the evening."There were bodies ripped apart, which shows the violence of the explosion," a nurse in the hospital's emergency room said.An army mine disposal team was sent in to investigate the accident and the type of mine which caused it.It could date from the country's struggle for independence from Portugal 40 years ago, military sources told national radio.Some 4 000 anti-personnel and anti-tank mines were left behind by Portuguese colonial army after the 1961-1974 war of independence, according to the anti-mine action centre, Caami.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
