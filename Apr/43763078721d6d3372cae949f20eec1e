A LOVE triangle is thought to be behind the murder-suicide of a couple in the city on Sunday night. Security guard Lungisani Makhanya (33) and Thembeka Ndlovu (23) worked for the same security company and had been involved in a relationship. However, Makhanya was also in a relationship with another woman, who was pregnant with his child. It appears that Ndlovu was unhappy when she visited Makhanya at his home to find him entertaining the pregnant woman and returned to her Dean Street home. Makhanya followed and an argument ensued in which he shot Ndlovu twice in the head and once in the leg. He then returned to his home and shot himself in the head, dying on the spot. Ndlovu was taken to Edendale Hospital where she died later.
