 I am not working but I m not unemployed, former National Youth Development Agency leader (NYDA) Andile Lungisa has said.Speaking after the postponement of his fraud case in the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crimes Court this morning, Lungisa referred queries about his case to his lawyer.He was only willing to speak about the upcoming elections and his prospects, he said. I am an ANC volunteer. I ve been campaigning every day, I ll breathe after the 7th of May, he said.Lungisa said he was focusing on his studies but was not yet registered at an institution. I am busy with ideological work. I m reading a lot and I m also writing, he said.Lungisa and his co-accused, which include his wife, Ursula Sali, Thabo Shogole and Xolisile Guqaza were charged for allegedly accepting and sharing among themselves R2.5 million given to them by the department of arts and culture to secure a performance by R&amp;B singer R Kelly at the Nelson Mandela Sports Day concert hosted last year.R Kelly left South Africa before the concert date.The case was postponed to June 9.Lungisa s lawyer, Thabo Kwinana, said they had asked for a postponement because they still needed documents from the state. The charge sheet as it stands doesn t provide enough particulars for us to be ready for the trial. It isn t as detailed as we would like it to be so we are requesting particulars, he said.But state prosecutor Ronel Dookun said she feared the request would create undue delays. This case has been waiting for trial since October. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
