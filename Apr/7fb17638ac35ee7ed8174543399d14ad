twice after failed prison escapes with inmates, The Star reported on Friday. In February, Okah and other inmates, including Sunday rapist
Jaco Steyn, attempted to escape from Leeuwkop Prison in Midrand. Okah was then
moved to New Lock Prison in Pretoria and again hatched another plan to escape
with other prisoners. The information emerged this week in documents before the North
Gauteng High Court in a failed application brought by Okah's wife Azuka and his
lawyer Idemudia Uriesi. The two claim Okah disappeared from New Lock Prison and
they had no idea where he was. They believed he was taken to an undisclosed
prison. Uriesi said he heard rumours that Okah was taken to Kokstad,
and accused correctional services of malice and having a hidden agenda. Uriesi asked that Okah be immediately returned to New Lock
Prison. The department's director Reuben Mbuli said Okah was moved
to Kokstad for security reasons because he was again involved in a prison
break. He and other inmates were transferred to Kokstad on 13 March. He said
the department was within its rights to move Okah and nobody had the right to
question it. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
